            <h1>Lighthouse of Shadows 2023</h1>
            <div>This was the final Game project we did at Future Games. <br>
                We had to do a game based on a designer made prototype in 4 weeks.
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li>I refined and fixed the already made movement code</li>
                <li>I made the grab and throw mechanic</li>
                <li>I made the music implementation</li>
            </ul>
            <div>
                This was a simple game to work on as most of my work was disconnected from the rest of the team so not
                alot of interprogrammer connected code <br>
                The project was the one I'm the most dissapointed in myself over as I felt that I didn't contribute
                enough <br>
                Although the game itself is quite well made and I'm proud of my team :3 <br>
