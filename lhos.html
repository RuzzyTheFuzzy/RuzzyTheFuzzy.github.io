            <h1>Lighthouse of Shadows 2023</h1>
            <div>This was the third Game project we did at Future Games. <br>
                We had to do a game about natural phenomenon in 4 weeks.
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li>I made most (all?) of the weapon mechanics</li>
                <li>I made testla coils that interact with the gun</li>
                <li>I made the lighthouse light stuff and spin</li>
                <li>Learnt how to make code for other programmers</li>
                <li>Learnt to not overdevelop code when it's not needed for the future</li>
                <li>Learnt that unreal blueprints are messy but an easy fix</li>
            </ul>
            <div>
                This was the messiest game project as the direction changed tons <br>
                The project was the vert frustrating and messy but came out looking very nice and looking back in kinda
